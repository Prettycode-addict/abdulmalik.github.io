        <h2>PERSONALITY IN SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>An outgoing student of life with zeal to learn and
          make an impact on people’s lives and also be a part of Africa’s
          success story. Astonished by technological advancements. My dream is
          to wake up to an Africa with zilch illiteracy, to an Africa with
          confidence, to an Africa with humane leaders who shy away from
          corruption and greed, to an Africa with optimism into the future!!! </p>

        <h2>ABOUT ME - JOURNEY TO FINDING ME</h2>
        <p>An economics graduate from the University of Ghana and former Credits
          Officer of Akwapim Rural Bank</p>
        <p>WHY MORINGA? <br> Basically it's a combination of the 2 things.
          The love for technology and the rejection from MEST. I think Moringa
          is capable of offering a great head start on my journey of being a
          hardcore programmer. Oh and like Edward Snowden</p>
